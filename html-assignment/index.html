    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Khaled Maarouf, I was born on the 19 <sup>th</sup> of July and raised in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. I am originally from Palestine, the land of olive oil and courages people, and one day I hope I am able to visit. I have played soccer my enbtire life, and in the past two years I have been playing soccer in the <em>Mens Premiere Division</em> in Ottawa. Right now its off season, but I plan to be training with the Algonquin Soccer Team this semester and be with them permanently in the new season.

    <p>Gaming is one of my favourite hobbies and recently, I started taking it more serious since I was Ranked 25th in North America for FIFA. I also started making money and have been creating contents on both tiktok and youtube. I would want to make it out there and get signed with an Esport team to represent them in all Pro tournaments.
        During COVID-19 I developed a new hobbie, video gaming, specifically <abbr title="Fédération Internationale de Football Association">FIFA</abbr>. Over the past couple of years I started to take this hobbie more seriously, turning it into a passion. Just as of November of 2024, I was ranked 25 <sup>th</sup> in North America in FIFA, obtaining a recognition as one of the best players in this side of the world. With video gaming, I started to make money of it and have been creating content on both TikTok and Youtube. My dream is to continue to grow and get signed with an eSport teamt to represent teams and clubs in all professional tournaments.
